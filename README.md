## About the Quiz
Click the start button to begin the quiz.  Answer each question by clicking on the button that you believe is the correct answer.  The page will display "Correct" or "Wrong" based on your answer choice.  If you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer.  The quiz is over when the timer reaches 0 or you are done answering all the questions.  At the end of the quiz, you will be informed of your score, and you will be asked to input and submit your initials.  High scores are displayed so that you can gauge your progress compared to your peers.
